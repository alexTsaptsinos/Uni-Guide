Repository for the now retired Uni Guide iOS application - a course finder for prospective UK university students.

The application was built on government provided open data, and run with a Parse backend. With the closure of Parse (thanks FB!) and lack of time to port it over, I have had to retire the application.

This was my first coding project ever and Objective-C was a tough first language to learn. As such, I apologise for the awful coding style and sloppiness that is undoubtedly present throughout.
