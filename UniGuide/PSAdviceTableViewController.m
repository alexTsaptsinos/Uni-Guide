You want this letter to sound natural and like you, expressing your thoughts and opinions while keeping it upbeat and enthusiastic. Don't overcomplicate it by reaching for the thesaurus at every word as this will turn your PS very stilted and disjointed. However, beware of overusing the word 'I', especially at the start of sentences as it can easily become repetitive - try and think of other phrases that could convey what you are trying to say.",@"You only have 47 lines and 4000 characters (including spaces) to get across what you want to say. Therefore try and avoid waffling or skirting around  a point that you want to raise. You won't need to explain to tutors parts of their subject, moreover it could come across as patronising! Keep in mind what you want each paragraph to say and make sure it says it without diverging too much as this will lose the readers interest.",@"Tutors will be reading hundred of statements so you need to think, what make you so different? Try and include things you've done that you think few other people will have and play around with the structure, tutors don't want to read the same formulaic approach to a PS every time. Beware with humour, it is extremely risky since you don't know whether the tutor will have the same sense of humour as you and it could backfire.",@"It doesn't have to all be written in one sitting. In a word processor, work on bits at a time, even if you know what you're writing down won't be the final product, write something down which you can then improve on later. Once you've written a first draft leave it for a day or two, then come back and scrutinise it thoroughly. Re-write and produce several drafts until you think you've found something that works. Show this to parents, teachers and anyone who'll read it for advice and to check grammar - try reading it out loud and seeing if it sounds good spoken. Finally make sure you spellcheck it and give it a final read over to check for any errors.", nil];

You should spend at least a paragraph explaining where this interest developed, how you have acted upon the interest and why you then want to further this interest at university. Try and pick out specific examples from the course that you enjoy rather than broadly claiming you love the whole subject.",@"So you've said why you like the course, but there are hundreds of other applicants who also like it - why should the tutor pick you to do it? Previously you've mentioned specific examples in the course you like, why not conjecture further what you want to learn more from and then where you will use this knowledge.

Avoid using 'passion' as it is an overused word every year - there are always other ways of phrasing what you are trying to say.",@"... don't say you have! This includes books you say you've read, hobbies you mention or qualifications you claim to have. The rule to go by is that if you couldn't answer questions on it in an interview then don't talk about it in your PS.",@"As wise and well versed as Nietzsche was it won't do your application any good by including his quotes.
